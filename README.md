This is an implementation of how the digital media applications like Netflix, Amazon Prime,etc help us with different movies/series recommendations according to our previously viewed or our preferences
This implementation contains two datasets that provide details of 4800+ movies and their credits. These two datasets help in the recommends.
These datasets were taken from Youtube where the code written is also inspired.
